I intend to go through the basic GAN paper, learning the fundamental principles, and then go on to some of the more recent gans and related concepts. I plan to provide annotation document as well as a synopsis of each article I read. Your thoughts and comments are really valuable, making this challenge a terrific resource for everyone. 


Please give my work a :thumbsup: ; it motivates me to do my best throughout the learning process. 

Have fun learning! :smile:
